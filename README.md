## Introduction

[DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) is a marvelous and powerful personal database system for macOS. If you're a long-time Unix/Linux user, you may find yourself wishing for a simple way to get data from DEVONthink from the command line and use it with (e.g.) shell scripts, command pipelines, and other typical Unix features. DEVONthink does support scripting via AppleScript (and [JavaScript](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/automating-dt-with-javascript-basics/65880)), but writing AppleScript or JavaScript code can be difficult and frustrating, especially if all you want is something simple such as the value of a metadata field of an item in DEVONthink.

_Ask-devonthink_ is a command-line program that lets you ask DEVONthink for the value of metadata fields for item(s) currently in your database.
